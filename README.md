# Project: Movies Data Analysis
In this project we will analyze the data associated with the valuation of 10,000 collected films 
associated mainly with the ratings of the users and the income generated. Some columns, like 'cast', 
'genres' and 'production_companies', contain multiple values separated by '|'

## The questions that I am trying to explore are:

1. What is the most frequent genres of movie in the 21st century?
2. How is the comparison in revenue and votes average of those films that had the highest budget in the last 10 years?
3. Which actors participated in more films in each of the genres?

## Libraries:

You will use Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Target Project:

- Investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Use pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Understand Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
